available hotels ordered by hotel rate.

### Response:

- provider: name of the provider (BestHotels or TopHotels)

### What you need to implement:
- A solution that meet the above requirements.
- You should consider the scalability in your solution, that means if we are going to add a
  new provider in the future , that should apply in a minimum changes and without effecting
  the current integration providers.

###Additional Instructions:
Please make sure that your code:
- Documented
- Redable
- Covered by unit tests. You can also cover it by any other tests you want.
- Don't use database in your implementation, itâ€™s just calling dummy URLs(example: localhost:8080/ CrazyHotel).
- send us GitHub URL
